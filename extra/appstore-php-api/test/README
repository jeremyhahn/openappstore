This testsuite uses the PHPUnit v3 framework. Once you have successfully installed phpunit,
execute the phpunit command inside the test directory to run all tests.

NOTE: Write permission must be granted to the test directory for the user account which php
	  executes as on your system if you want the download test to succeed. This test also assumes
	  that you have created a new application with an id of 3. Be sure to examine the test code to
	  be sure it will work with your appstore configuration!
